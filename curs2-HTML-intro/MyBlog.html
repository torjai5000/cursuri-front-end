  <h3>Interesting facts:</h3>
  <em>Starting from the bottom and now we're still on the bottom but motivated</em>
  <p>I'm a student of the Technical University of Cluj-Napoca at the Building Services faculty. Altough this is my last semester before getting my Masters degree, 
    I decided that I'll try to become a programmer. In highschool, I was in the math-informatics departament so after all it's not an entirely new area, but I understand
    that I have to learn a lot to become successful in the field. This is the reason I started this course.</p>
  <em>I don't like bees</em> 
  <p>Nor wasps. I like to think that I'm adventureous. I like trying out new things that might be a little extreme in some cases. Bungee jumping, paragliding, 
    sitting on the edge of a cliff, climbing without safety equipment, MINIGOLFING. I hate bees though. If you see one coming at me, you might also see me running 
    from it.</p>
  <em>I'm a musician...ish</em>
  <p>I learned how to play the guitar when I was young from a teacher. I didn't like it though, so I kind-of left it behind me. The next instrument was the piano which 
    I learned on my own and I love it till this day. Also, it goes well with my passion to singing. I have a few melodies that I wrote, even a videoclip of a cover on
    <a href="http://www.youtube.com">Youtube</a>.
    Anyway, it was never a career option, just a <spam style="color:green">hobby</spam> and this is probably the reason that I love it and will love it in the future.</p>
